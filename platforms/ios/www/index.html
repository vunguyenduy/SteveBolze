        Cheap gas will overtake renewables, energy chief warns
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>Steve Bolze of General Electric unable to say if a glut of gas power stations would undermine 2050 global emissions targets</div><br/>
        <div>A glut of cheap gas will see the fuel overtake renewable sources in the global race to build new energy generation, says a senior energy industry executive.</div><br/>

        <div>"More gas [power plants] than wind and solar will be built [in the 10 to 20 years]," said Steve Bolze, chief executive of General Electric's power and water division, which makes gas-fired turbines. "Gas is a good alternative to being 100% renewable."</div><br/>

        <div>However, he was unable to say whether a massive increase in gas-fired power generation would be consistent with the world meeting its climate change target of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 compared with 1990 levels, which scientists say is the only way to avoid dangerous levels of global warming.</div><br/>

        <div>He said: "We need not only to be able to work through these targets, but also to deliver the power that is required in the world. Our role is to supply the industry – and we are seeing more demand for gas."</div><br/>

        <div>The International Energy Agency has predicted that if the anticipated "dash for gas" goes ahead, the world will be far adrift of its greenhouse gas emissions targets. Laszlo Varro, head of gas, coal and power markets at the IEA, said: "We have said repeatedly that on our current trajectory we will miss these targets."</div><br/>

        <div>GE is putting its engineering and marketing muscle strongly behind gas – the company has just launched a new gas-fired turbine that is being billed as complementary to renewable energy. The new turbine is more efficient, and its key selling point is that it can be sparked up or powered down much more quickly than previous models. The company says this means it is a good way of providing back-up for intermittent renewable generation from wind turbines – which the company also manufactures to a lesser degree.</div><br/>

        <div>"When the wind doesn't blow or the sun doesn't shine, gas is an efficient way of meeting demand," said Bolze.</div><br/>

        <div>Gas companies have been stepping up their lobbying efforts in recent months, in an attempt to persuade policymakers around the world that an abundance of unconventional gas – fuel that was previously too expensive to exploit or inaccessible because it is bound up in dense rocks – means the fossil fuel is the best way to meet rising demand for power and cut greenhouse gas emissions.</div><br/>

        <div>This argument is rapidly gaining traction in the US in particular, where a rush to exploit shale gas reserves is spurring the construction of gas-fired power plants. "The US will be a gas island, because there is so much local supply, and it may be cheaper than gas traded in the rest of the world," said Varro.</div><br/>

        <div>Gas is being positioned as a low-carbon fuel – burned in a power station, it produces about half of the carbon associated with coal. However, this is not the whole story; a recent study showed that the most common form of unconventional gas, shale gas, which is released by fracturing dense rock formations, produces as much carbon as coal because of problems with its production.</div><br/>

        <div>As Bolze's remarks illustrate, this new "dash for gas" is likely to be at the expense of renewables. A report from the European Gas Advocacy Forum suggested that Europe could meet its carbon-cutting targets hundreds of billions of euros more cheaply by pursuing gas than by relying on renewables.</div><br/>

        <div>GE contends that gas can be complementary to renewables. "To have more renewable energy on the grid, you need to have more flexibility, other forms of power," Bolze said.</div><br/>

        <div>However, building a massive new fleet of gas-fired power stations around the world would effectively lock in fossil fuel generation for decades, because each new plant has an operating life of at least 25 years.</div><br/>

        <div>The UK's committee on climate change has warned that all British energy generation must be decarbonised by 2030, and the same is likely to be true of other developed countries if they are to comply with scientific advice on emissions. This would mean that gas-fired power stations built in the next decade would have to be taken out of commission before the end of their lives or fitted with carbon capture and storage technology (CCS).</div><br/>

        <div>Green campaigners fear that relying on CCS is dangerous because the technology is unproven and may be extremely expensive. There are no power plants currently using CCS at scale.</div><br/>

        <div>Bolze was unable to say how much the company spends on CCS research and development, but conceded it was "a small portion" of the $1bn GE devotes to clean energy projects.</div><br/>

        Coal to outweigh oil in five year's time
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>Coal will surpass oil as the world's dominant fuel by 2018, and the mainland will be the dominant contributor to the development, an energy consultancy said.</div><br/>

        <div>The prediction highlights the difficulty to rein in reliance on pollution-prone coal, given its relative abundance and economic attractiveness.</div><br/>

        <div>"China and India's aggressive power requirements will be responsible for coal's burgeoning role in energy, but the United States, Europe and [the rest of] Asia will still contribute to coal demand," said London-based Wood Mackenzie's president of global markets William Durbin at the sidelines of the World Energy Congress.</div><br/>

        <div>Driven by urbanisation and industrialisation, "China's demand for coal will almost single-handedly propel the growth of coal as the dominant global fuel", he added.</div><br/>

        <div>The consultancy projected that global coal demand would rise 25 per cent between 2010 and 2020 to 4.5 billion tonnes of oil equivalent, compared with 4.4 billion tonnes of oil consumed that year. Coal is expected to overtake oil in 2018.</div><br/>

        <div>The forecast is based on the assumption that the mainland's coal-fired power generation will satisfy almost half of power demand growth between last year and 2020, which is estimated to average 7 per cent a year.</div><br/>

        <div>The continuation of coal's dominance as a fuel source is due to a limited supply of domestic natural gas, high cost of gas imports and instability of renewable power output.</div><br/>

        <div>Durbin said coal's price competitiveness meant its demand would remain stable until the end of the decade even in regions other than China and India.</div><br/>

        <div>This is even though natural gas and renewable energy make up the bulk of incremental power capacity in Europe, the US and other parts of Asia.</div><br/>

        <div>French-based energy major GDF Suez chairman Gerard Mestrallet said an influx of cheap coal from the US caused by rising shale gas output saw European power generators decide to close 50 gigawatts of gas-fired power plants this year as coal-fired power output increased.</div><br/>

        <div>In North America, despite the abundance of low-cost natural gas, coal is even cheaper due to a surplus supply and it will keep existing coal-fired power stations in operation.</div><br/>

        <div>General Electric chief executive Steve Bolze told the congress that coal-fired plants would still supply about 30 per cent of power output in the US in a decade, although improved technology had reduced greenhouse gas emission from new plants by 13 per cent per unit of output.</div><br/>

        <div>The ratio stood at 42 per cent in 2011, according to the US Energy Information Administration.</div><br/>

        <div>Growing reliance of coal in the global energy mix partly reflected a failure by world leaders to forge a globally binding commitment to carbon reduction in past years.</div><br/>

        <div>Developing nations are worried that adoption of costlier, cleaner fuel and emission control technologies would dent economic expansion.</div><br/>

        <div>A lack of commitment by some major developed economies such as the US is also to blame.</div><br/>

        <div>In a report on the world's potential energy consumption and supply patterns up to 2050, the World Energy Council modelled a scenario where government intervention led to lower economic growth and emissions and another where the world saw higher growth and emissions under less intervention.</div><br/>

        <div>"The hard truth is that in both [scenarios], we seem unable to mitigate the climate challenge in time to the extent our scientists believe is necessary to avoid the risk of dramatic climate effects," the council said.</div><br/>

        <div>While technology is available to capture carbon dioxide at power plants and factories and store it underground, the council said it might cost US$40 to US$80 per tonne in 2020 and large-scale commercialisation might not come until 2035.</div><br/>

        GE Enters IT Services Market to Save Companies $150BN
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>Through a partnership with Accenture, GE developed nine technology and service offerings that aim to assist organizations across several verticals to reduce technology overhead and streamline operations in the process. The company’s estimates that its new portfolio,  which is primarily targeted at airlines, railroads, hospitals, manufacturers and utilities, could save these companies up to $150 billion on an industry-wide scale.</div><br/>

        <div>GE put aside one billion dollars for this initiative, one of many that CEO Jeff Immelt architected to boost his firm’s margins  by 0.5 percent to 0.7 percent  in the next 12 months.</div><br/>

        <div>“Given the environment, some of the uncertainties, etc., services is an area that plays for the long term because of the…ongoing desire from customers for new levels of productivity,” said Steve Bolze, the chief executive officer of GE’s power and water business, who is also heading up the company’s services push.</div><br/>

        <div>GE’s new IT offerings are categorized based on their specific goals: optimizing networks, optimizing plants and facilities, optimizing assets and service quality and productivity.</div><br/>

        <div>GE Aviation’s Intelligent Operations services rely on sensory data from aircraft equipment to minimize maintenance related flight delays. Another offering leverages analytics software to stream real-time railroad data, while the Grid IQ SaaS offers energy companies on-demand admin capabilities that can be implemented twice as fast as any other solution.</div><br/>

        <div>The IT services market is a very lucrative one, and attracts not only Silicon Valley heavyweights but also vendors whose core business is not necessary related to this area. Large accounting firms are drifting in the same direction  and have already begun competing with traditional service providers, but some SPs retain their dominance in the market.  Accenture is among them, a fact that GE undoubtedly took into consideration.</div><br/>

        GE Power Generation Products and Services unit launched in China
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>GE has recently launched a new business unit in China, with the aim of pursuing growth opportunities for the company’s power generation products and services that can meet the demand for cleaner, more energy efficient solutions.</div><br/>

        <div>The new business is headquartered in Beijing and includes GE’s heavy duty gas turbine, steam turbine, generator and gasification products and services. Yang Dan has been appointed the general manager of the Power Generation Products and Services China unit.</div><br/>

        <div>GE is realigning several of its Power & Water businesses in China because the country is a unique region that requires greater emphasis on building relationships and the greater localisation of GE’s business resources to enhance GE’s existing local partnerships. The dedicated Power Generation Products and Services unit will support efforts by these local partnerships to help China address the growing demand for power, which is expected to double in the next 10 years.</div><br/>

        <div>Steve Bolze, President and CEO of GE Power & Water, has outlined how one of the top priorities for the new business is to increase GE’s local capabilities by optimising the company’s power generation partners in China, including Harbin Electric for heavy duty gas turbine projects, and Nanjing Turbine and Electric Machinery Company (NTC) in both gas and steam turbines.</div><br/>

        <div>This realignment of GE’s thermal and power generation services teams does not affect GE Power & Water’s existing renewables, distributed power, water and nuclear teams in China. GE is making the move to address China’s unique local dynamics and is not planning to make any similar changes in other countries.</div><br/>

        GE Sees Gas Turbine Sales Gain Amid Saudis' Solar Shift
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>General Electric Co. (GE) predicts demand for its gas turbines will increase in Saudi Arabia, even with the kingdom working to supply a third of power needs from solar energy within the next two decades.</div><br/>

        <div>Saudi Arabia already has 500 installed gas turbines from GE that generate about half its electricity, and the Middle Eastern country plans to more than double its power capacity by 2030 to meet utility-demand growth of about 8 percent a year.</div><br/>

        <div>“In the short- to medium-term, it’s still a lot of thermal power, so we will support that just like we have been, both by providing advanced technology and servicing it locally,” Steve Bolze, head of GE Power & Water, said in an Oct. 1 interview in Dammam.</div><br/>

        <div>The company announced an order for eight gas-turbine generators to expand a power plant in Riyadh the day before, as Saudi Arabia adds 33,000 megawatts of generation capacity in the next eight years alone.</div><br/>

        <div>GE, which draws about half of its approximately $10 billion a year in Middle Eastern sales from energy, expects to benefit from climbing solar demand in that period, too.</div><br/>

        <div>Saudi Arabia’s central government, seeking to curb crude oil use internally to preserve more of the fuel for export, is seeking $109 billion of investment to build a solar industry.</div><br/>

        <div>The target is almost as much as the $136 billion invested worldwide in solar energy last year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. That may boost sales of concentrated solar panels, “which are really the ones that get a lot of attention from our customer base in Saudi Arabia,” Bolze said.</div><br/>

        <div>Renewable Energy</div><br/>

        <div>Talks are under way with Saudi customers about developing other renewable-energy resources as well, Bolze said. GE said in June 2011 that it expected to double energy revenue from Saudi Arabia in five years by increasing sales of gas turbines, while helping the country curb the amount of oil needed locally to produce electricity.</div><br/>

        <div>Renewables are the second-largest business at GE Energy, and gas turbines are the biggest. The Fairfield, Connecticut- based company introduced a new line of gas-powered turbines in September that are designed to run alongside renewable-energy installations, powering up when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing.</div><br/>

        <div>Saudi Electricity Co. (SECO) is one of the first clients for the new technology, Bolze said. The push to develop renewables would help curb the kingdom’s use of heavy fuel oil, which was about 65 percent of that of the U.S. this year and 41 percent of that of China, according to government figures on the Joint Organisations Data Initiative website.</div><br/>

        <div>Saudi Arabia may need to import oil by 2030 if the country’s domestic crude use continues to outpace gains in production, New York-based Citigroup said in a September report. The kingdom depends on oil for 86 percent of its annual revenue.</div><br/>

        GE to fill hefty order
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>SCHENECTADY — General Electric is ready to fulfill one of the largest orders the Schenectady manufacturing facility has ever seen in its 121-year history.</div><br/>

        <div>The company just signed off on three contracts worth $2.7 billion to build 26 gas turbines, 12 steam turbines and 38 generators for Sonelgaz, Algeria’s state-run electricity and gas company. The agreement includes equipment and services that will help strengthen the North African country’s power sector, boost its electricity grid, and meet a rapidly growing demand for energy.</div><br/>

        <div>The work will be split between GE Power & Water’s Schenectady headquarters and its Greenville, S.C., facility. The Schenectady plant will make the steam turbines and generators. The Greenville plant will make the gas turbines.</div><br/>

        <div>While the company won’t further expand its workforce due to this latest order, the Schenectady steam turbine and generator operation has been growing steadily for the past two years with both new products and expanded work. Work has already begun on the latest order and will be a large portion of the Schenectady plant’s workload for up to two years.</div><br/>

        <div>“We’ve hired approximately 450 production employees since mid-2011, including a ramp-up in anticipation of being ready to support the Algerian order,” said GE spokeswoman Chris Horne in an email.</div><br/>

        <div>One of the three contracts is with SPE Spa, a subsidiary of the Sonelgaz Group. For $1.9 billion, GE will provide power generation equipment and services for six new combined-cycle power plants that together will produce enough electricity to power 8 million Algerian households. These plants will use 9F 3-series gas turbines, which use a dual-fuel combustion technology that reduces emissions and extends maintenance intervals. Overall, these services are expected to increase Algeria’s energy capacity by nearly 70 percent.</div><br/>

        <div>In addition, GE entered into a long-term joint venture with Sonelgaz to develop a new production facility in Algeria that will eventually produce more than 2 gigawatts of power generation equipment a year. This facility would cater to the needs of any future power plants and create nearly 400 jobs in Algeria and potentially another 600 indirect jobs there.</div><br/>

        <div>Another contract already delivered advanced aeroderivative gas turbines to Algeria this summer to help meet peak electricity demand. This agreement came on the heels of an October 2012 contract to supply 24 of these gas turbines for two “fast-track” projects in northern Algeria.</div><br/>

        <div>The final contract, again with SPE Spa, was worth more than $150 million to supply power generation equipment to a simple-cycle gas turbine plant in the Algerian town of Hassi R’mel. This equipment would add about 370 megawatts of power to Algeria’s electricity grid.</div><br/>

        <div>“Our latest agreements with Sonelgaz underscore our continuing commitment to supply the best technology and services to assist Algeria in meeting its growing energy needs,” Steve Bolze, president and CEO of GE Power & Water, said in a news release. “These recent announcements demonstrate GE’s capability to provide proven technology that can address both the immediate need for more power and the long-term energy requirements of a growing economy. In addition, the new GE-Sonelgaz industrial cooperation is further evidence that we are invested in the future of Algeria’s energy infrastructure.”</div><br/>

        <div>GE has had a relationship with Algeria, which is rich in natural gas and oil reserves, for more than 40 years now. The Algerian government wants to boost its energy generation capacity, as energy demand is estimated to be growing at an average annual rate of about 14 percent.</div><br/>

        GE's Bolze Says Emerging Markets Drive Demand Growth for Energy Equipment
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>General Electric Co., the world’s biggest maker of power-generation equipment, said demand is growing most quickly in emerging markets and nations with a clear energy policy.</div><br/>

        <div>“We are in a multi-speed recovery,” Steve Bolze, head of the GE Power & Water unit, said in an interview at the World Energy Congress in Montreal. “Certain parts of the world, China, parts of Latin America, Brazil, are growing significantly. Some countries are in moderate recovery mode,” such as the U.S. and parts of Europe, and others are dealing with sovereign-debt issues, he said.</div><br/>

        <div>China is now the biggest market for wind, and GE is also selling more equipment there that turns coal into gas for cleaner-burning fuel, Bolze said. Demand is rising in the Middle East and India, while a lack of national energy policies is curbing growth in the U.S., especially for environmentally friendlier products, Bolze said.</div><br/>

        <div>“We are seeing our customers being very cautious on some investments until that’s clarified,” Bolze said. “We go to Eastern Europe, Africa, Latin America, where the opportunities are for us.”</div><br/>

        <div>Interest in so-called distributed generation, on-site or remote and emergency power, is increasing, particularly in developing countries such as Saudi Arabia and in Latin America, Bolze said.</div><br/>

        <div>GE, whose equipment produces one-third of the world’s electricity, is the world’s second-biggest maker of wind turbines behind Denmark’s Vestas Wind Systems A/S.</div><br/>

        <div>Other businesses include biogas, natural gas and steam turbines. GE boosted access to offshore wind-turbine technology last year with its purchase of the ScanWind unit of Morphic Technologies AB in Sweden.</div><br/>

        <div>As the parent company, based in Fairfield, Connecticut, raises spending on research and development, Bolze said his unit is also seeking acquisitions in technologically advanced areas including wind and distributed generation.</div><br/>

        General Electric's Steve Bolze A man with power on his mind
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>General Electric Co. executive Steve Bolze is in charge of a huge range of the conglomerate’s businesses, ranging from nuclear power to wind turbines to gas-powered engines. His purview, as president of GE Power & Water, even includes water technology such as purification and desalination. Mr. Bolze was in Toronto recently to talk about how cheap and plentiful natural gas is changing the power business, and how Canada is in the sweet spot for unconventional fuel.</div><br/>

        <div>How have low gas prices affected your power business?</div><br/>

        <div>Gas prices are going to remain at a lower point than anybody would have forecast four or five years ago. This is not a two-year cycle or a five-year cycle. We see this as a 30-year-plus cycle. We are going to invest accordingly. If I look at product development and technology advancement, gas turbines and compressors are really the biggest space in investment in GE.</div><br/>

        <div>How does Canada fit into that?</div><br/>

        <div>The macro trend in the world is centred around unconventional fuels and unconventional resources. What you have in Canada is the third-largest unconventional [fuel] resource on the planet. So people are watching. It is one of our fastest-growing regions and one where we have to apply more of a developing mindset in terms of how we invest and how we allocate resources.</div><br/>

        <div>One of our businesses is water technology and treatment [and] most challenging projects in the world are in Canada. Technology solutions which are world class are being adapted and prototyped and implemented here first. Canada is really at the epicentre of a lot of what is going on [in the power business]. That is why we are investing here.</div><br/>

        <div>What are the key technological advances in the gas turbine business?</div><br/>

        <div>One of them is around flexibility – the ability to make quick starts or turndowns to stay within emissions parameters. The second is focused on efficiency – we continue to push new levels of base load efficiency. The third big area of focus is on the combustion cycle, because you want fuel flexibility. There are different types or gradations of gas, and you want to [be able to handle] duel fuel or tri-fuel.</div><br/>

        <div>Is there a decrease in interest in renewables, with so much attention moving to gas?</div><br/>

        <div>The renewables that people talk about the most are wind and solar. Both continue to evolve in terms of efficiency as well as competitiveness [measured in] cents per kilowatt hour. Solar is still the farthest out in terms of its competitiveness [but] GE is investing in primary materials science to advance the technology.</div><br/>

        <div>In wind, there has been a lot of investment. The availability and reliability of the units have gotten much more competitive versus other options.</div><br/>

        <div>How do you see the global mix of energy generation evolving in the future?</div><br/>

        <div>You are always going to have a diversified grid, no matter where you are in the world. There will be renewables, gas, and in many places, hydro, coal and nuclear. Our business has always [sold] a diverse set of solutions. The slant of our investments is towards gas [along with] a long-term trend to renewables.</div><br/>

        <div>Is it a problem that government incentives for renewable power are so uncertain?</div><br/>

        <div>What the industry needs is long-term, predictable policy in renewables. Some areas of the world have that. Other areas of the world don’t. Where you don’t see it, you see ramps and pullbacks of investment. The U.S. is in that environment today. We run a global business, so as certain markets cycle down for a given year or two, we invest in different parts of the world. One of the things we have learned is that you have to invest through the cycles, otherwise you don’t stay competitive.</div><br/>

        <div>Where are the technological advances coming with wind turbines?</div><br/>

        <div>One of the products we launched about 15-18 months ago was a 1.6-megawatt turbine with a 100-metre rotor. It is more than 20 per cent more valuable for the same wind regime, compared to competitive options. We put in over 1,200 of those units last year.</div><br/>

        <div>And GE just announced our new 2.5-megawatt machine which has a 120-metre rotor. It has batteries in it, which allows a customer to power through small periods of intermittent wind. That is a game changer, I think.</div><br/>

        <div>Is storage key for wind systems?</div><br/>

        <div>If you can get more long-term storage, that is huge. What people use today to levelize [power output] is gas power. But if you can move to longer-term storage, that is a big opportunity.</div><br/>

        <div>These new GE units also have a certain level of monitoring and sensing in them, which we can also retrofit to existing units. So if you have a wind park with 100 turbines, they can talk to each other. Units at the front of the park know what the wind speed is before the back of the park does. You can adjust for that, in the wind blades, and you can get 1 or 2 per cent more output for the park.</div><br/>

        <div>How important is distributed power, where electricity is generated close to where it is used?</div><br/>

        <div>One of the biggest themes in power generation in the world today is distributed power. [It is ideal for] areas that don’t have grid capacity or grid connections. It is going into rural villages. It is going into remote sites for oil and gas applications. That whole space is going to continue to grow.</div><br/>

        <div>Is your nuclear business slowing?</div><br/>

        <div>Nuclear power still has a role to play. That is not going to change. Clearly the industry has looked at and applied lessons learned from what happened with [the disaster at the] Fukushima [nuclear power plant in Japan]. But there are still countries in the world that are building nuclear power today – China and the United States, for example. Our joint venture, GE Hitachi, is completing the construction of a power plant in Taiwan. The challenge for the nuclear industry is the capital cost, up front, associated with building a nuclear power plant. It is a big ticket.</div><br/>

        <div>Where are the key growth areas in water treatment at GE?</div><br/>

        <div>The biggest opportunities for water technology right now are in water reuse and advanced waste-water treatment. Some of the opportunities are in the oil sands area. Water solutions for SAGD [steam-assisted gravity drainage] applications are big.</div><br/>

        <div>Is desalination a big market for GE?</div><br/>

        <div>We have desalination technology. The big [question] is how to do it on a more efficient basis. There are some tough water issues to be resolved, for industrial applications, and that is where we are spending a lot of our dollars.</div><br/>

        <div>What is the most exciting technology you see in the power and water group at GE at the moment?</div><br/>

        <div>I’d say it is the integration of high-efficiency but flexible gas turbines, with wind power. They play together very well.</div><br/>

        Saudi Aramco, GE Power speak at World Energy Congress
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>In the first keynote speech of the World Energy Congress, president and CEO of Saudi Aramco, Khalid A. Al-Falih, and President and CEO of GE Power & Water, Steve Bolze, summed up the energy challenges of the coming decades.</div><br/>

        <div>The duo put forward a line-up of solutions — from greater investment in education and technology to support for free trade and intellectual property.</div><br/>

        <div>Al-Falih, whose state-run company ranks first among oil companies worldwide in terms of crude oil production and exports, told the audience that the energy market has become more dynamic and confident than ever since the last World Energy Congress in Montreal in 2010.</div><br/>

        <div>That makes Korea an ideal location for the conference, he said. “The key ingredient has been the energy of the Korean people,” he said. “And that provides the perfect backdrop to this Congress, where harnessing all the energy at our disposal will be fundamental to future success.”</div><br/>

        <div>But, he added, challenges remain. By 2050, the global economy will be three and “hopefully” four times larger. “More people and affluence mean more mobility, more urbanization, and more demand for durable and consumable goods. That in turn will drive consumption for fuels, electricity, and chemical feedstocks; and therefore energy.”</div><br/>

        <div>“But it is not preordained that demand has to rise to unsustainable levels, even if we provide everyone with sufficient energy,” he said.</div><br/>

        <div>Al-Falih called for the supply side of the energy market to move towards what the WEC calls the “jazz scenario,” a more decentralized system to ensure energy access, affordability and quality of supply. He advocated more progressive and pragmatic policies, including greater and long-term investments, ensuring market stability, enhancing the competitiveness of renewable energies, the need for cleaner and lower priced fossil fuels, safer nuclear plants, and an attitude of collaboration among global energy actors.</div><br/>

        <div>He added that Saudi Aramco and the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) have established a research partnership, looking into carbon capture and converting CO2 into useful products.</div><br/>

        <div>Bolze, the second keynote speaker, delivered a message emphasizing a number of recent developments: the rise of “brilliant machines” that can process massive amounts of data and increase productivity, the increased prominence of natural gas as an energy source, the importance of “distributive power” as the global energy market becomes decentralized, and the coming age of mainstream renewable energies such as wind power.</div><br/>

        <div>Putting forward policy proposals, Bolze advocated support for free trade, the protection of intellectual property to encourage entrepreneurs, and greater backing for education and training.</div><br/>

        <div>The pair then sat down for a 10-minute discussion with moderator and WEC Secretary General Dr. Christoph Frei, who asked about uncertainties in the global market and the shale gas revolution. “Uncertainty has been part of the landscape since our beginning,” said Al-Falih, adding that Saudi Arabia has taken on a policy of “extra capacity” to cushion the market from global swings.</div><br/>

        <div>This news story is based on the Keynote Speeches session at the 2013 World Energy Congress.</div><br/>
